This project demonstrates an image processing application that applies various filters and transformations to images using multithreading concepts, allowing for parallel processing. The project is implemented in C++ and utilizes multithreading to divide the image processing task into smaller subtasks that can be executed concurrently.

## Features
- Load an image file in common formats (e.g., BMP, PNG, JPEG).
- Apply various image filters and transformations, such as:
   - Grayscale conversion
   - Image blurring
   - Edge detection
   - Image resizing
- Utilize multithreading to process different portions of the image in parallel.
- Combine the processed subimages to obtain the final transformed image.
- Save the transformed image to a new file.
